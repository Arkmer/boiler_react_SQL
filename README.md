# Sick Boilerplate Code!
I made some basic code in React that will allow you to start a bit faster.

Steps to starting:
1. "npm i" in your terminal
2. Follow the instructions in the .sql file
3. "npm start" in your terminal
4. Open a new terminal tab, "npm run-script server" in the new tab
5. Navigate the the content page
6. Press both buttons
7. View the console log; it shoud say three things: "Client: Success", "Server: Success", and "Database: Success"
8. If it does not say those three things, find a fix for the error
9. Continue developing your application

This code does not include:
- Oauth2
- Redux

This code uses:
- React
- Express
- Axios
- PostreSQL

Things for the future:
- Prestyle the nav bar
- Page loads onto Content link and not a blank page

Thanks for reading!
